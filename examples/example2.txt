If you're wondering how one produces
 cool text fonts like you see above, 
 it's fairly simple (but maybe not what y
 ou'd expect). Basically, the text that gets generated isn't actually a font - it's a bunch of symbols that are in the unicode standard. You're reading symbols that are in the unicode standard right now - the alphabet is a part of it, as are all the regular symbols on your keyboard: !@#$%^&*() etc.

So the difference is, these rad "fonts" that are produces, just don't happen to appear on your keyboard - there's not enough room. The unicode standard has more than 100,000 symbols defined in it. That's a lot of symbols. And amongst those symbols are many different "alphabets" - some of which this translator is able to produce.
